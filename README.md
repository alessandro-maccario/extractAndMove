# Create a simple ExtractAndMove script

## Problem Breakdown

The purpose of this script is to:

1. Manually unzip a folder
2. Extract the content of each of the folders available from the zip extraction
3. For each file, assign the folder's name to it (where the folder's name represents the name of a student)
4. Move those files in a "main" folder, to be easily accessible.

The entire application has been created by using CustomTkinter, a library built on top of Tkinter to make the UI more modern.
